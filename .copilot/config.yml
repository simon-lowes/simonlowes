    When modifying the site's layout or styling, prefer modern CSS approaches such as Flexbox and Grid.
    Avoid introducing new dependencies or frameworks.
    Keep all spacing, colours, and typography consistent with the existing design.
    Ensure changes support a fully responsive layout from 320px mobile widths upwards.
    When editing `index.html` or `css/style.css`, maintain a clean structure and avoid fixed positioning that breaks on smaller screens.
    Always propose a clear plan before applying changes.
    After making edits, provide concise commit messages summarising what was changed and why.
